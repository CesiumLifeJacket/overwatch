## TODO:
 - Get the website working. The website should take the location of the project root directory containing the appropriate `.style_violations.json` file and produce a navigable, interactive report for the code files in the project. see `dummy_project/` for an example project directory.
 - Create more langauge interfaces. These should be implemented as python modules in `command-line/stylecheckers` and should follow the interface set forth by the modules `pep8` and `fsharplint` modules in that directory.
