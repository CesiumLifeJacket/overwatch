# Overwatch

- Make sure this works on Windoze
 - Probably can't rely on pep8 being on the path, use pep8 python module instead.
- Make the website pretty.
 - file/folder icons.
 - add links to each parent directory at top of each directory page
 - ability to filter by error types / hide certain error types
- Add Continous Integration support with Git hooks
- Create more langauge interfaces. These should be implemented as python modules in `command-line/stylecheckers` and should follow the interface set forth by the modules `pep8` and `fsharplint` modules in that directory.
