## TODO:
 - Make the website pretty. Add back buttons, file/folder icons. ability to filter by error types
 - Create more langauge interfaces. These should be implemented as python modules in `command-line/stylecheckers` and should follow the interface set forth by the modules `pep8` and `fsharplint` modules in that directory.
